# CPC Zurich 2021 - CPC Challenge Bot

This is the bot that was used for the CPC Challenge at the CPC Zurich 2021.

## Getting started
You will need to open the `constant.js` file and redefine the `SLACK_OAUTH_TOKEN` value.
A good tutorial on how to define this variables can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AajBk59nOgw).

Once everything is set up, you can run the bot locally by navigating to the repository folder and typing `yarn start`.
